## Zip Compression Plugin

The **Zip Compression Plugin** is a built-in, plug-and-play integration for the FlowSynx automation engine. It enables compressing and decompressing files and folders using the ZIP format within workflows, with no custom coding required.

This plugin is automatically installed by the FlowSynx engine when selected in the workflow builder. It is not intended for standalone developer usage outside the FlowSynx platform.

## Purpose

The Zip Compression Plugin allows FlowSynx users to:

- Compress files or folders into a ZIP archive.

It integrates seamlessly into FlowSynx no-code/low-code workflows for file management and data transfer tasks.
